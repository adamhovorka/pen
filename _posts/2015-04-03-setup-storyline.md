Welcome, reader. I'm Adam, the GM. This, "Pen," is an interactive story, of sorts; I'll be writing everything in these large blocks of text, but you'll be controlling what happens by writing in the comments below each post.

This is going to be pretty free-form. In designing and writing this, I'm aiming for consistency and scope, which means any loopholes you spot are free to be exploited—in fact, they may be intentional. Nag me about any details I neglect that you think might give you an edge in a situation. If you can make a convincing argument that something should happen, I'll roll with it. If I don't, point it out and shame me about it. I'm serious. This designed to be improv practice for me as much as entertaining for you, the readers. If I'm doing something wrong, tell me.

Now, the first thing we need to do is pick a storyline to follow. I've prepared four worlds for you to choose from. Each has a unique setting/plot framework and a core mechanic. Choose wisely.

**Frontier**

You signed on to the *JCTS Heinlein* because past you was bored and thought present you (formerly future you) could handle a little more excitement in your life. Past you was an idiot.

Mechanic: Space travel. For those of you in the know, yes, this may overlap with Project Miranda.

**Surreal**

You have the distinct feeling that the world you're seeing isn't real. Normally you'd just brush this off, but today someone approaches you with proof.

Mechanic: It's a secret. Figuring it out is part of the fun. I will say that it's one that I've seen done very poorly, and I intend to do it the right way here.

**Timed**

A friend is putting the finishing touches on their time machine when they discover evidence that it's been used.

Mechanic: Time travel.

**Lurking**

Wanted: Private live-in wizardry tutor. Negotiable pay. Private room, great view. Last tutor disappeared without a trace, so all his furnishings are still here. Must not be currently affiliated with any of the large schools. Experience with enchanting a plus. Apply at Fabre tower in East Nordon.

Mechanic: Magic, done my way.
